# Godot Space Invaders
This is my third game in the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io).
This is an implementation of the Space Invaders game. This game includes invaders which
will bounce back and forth across the screen along with a mothership that will occasionally
go across the top of the screen. The invaders will drop bullets downward while the player
can shoot bullets upward. Enemy bullets and the player bullet can destroy each other. There
are also three bunkers that can be destroyed by attacking them from both the player or aliens.

The player wins by destroying all of the invading aliens. The aliens win by touching down
on the ground, or destroying the player. The player has three lives.
